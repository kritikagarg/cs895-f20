# BidenCheated Hashtag spread on Twitter

At the end of November 2020 in a response to the US presidential election, a large amount of tweets were generated by many accounts that included #BidenCheated. How far did these spammed tweets reach across a potential twitter network? What was the rate of the spread of information based on follower activity? Was there bot activity that is detectable? How much did this contribute to the spread of disinformation? This project investigates each of these questions from a dataset extracted from Twitter for that time period on the #BidenCheated topic.
